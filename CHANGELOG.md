## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Fixed

### Security

## [0.8.2] - 2025-12-30

- TAG: [v0.8.2][0.8.2t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 130/130 lines in 4 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 40/40 branches in 4 files
- 50.00% documented

### Added

- `Yard::Fence::RakeTask` - New rake task class that provides `yard:fence:prepare` and `yard:fence:clean` tasks
  - Automatically enhances the `:yard` task when defined
  - Auto-registers when Rake is available at gem load time
- `Yard::Fence.prepare_for_yard` - New method to prepare for YARD documentation generation
  - Combines `clean_docs_directory` and `prepare_tmp_files` into a single call
  - Intended to be called from rake tasks, not at load time

### Deprecated

- `Yard::Fence.at_load_hook` - Now does nothing; use `prepare_for_yard` via rake task instead

### Removed

- **BREAKING**: Removed load-time execution of `clean_docs_directory` and `prepare_tmp_files`
  - Previously, these ran when yard-fence was loaded, causing `docs/` to be cleared during unrelated rake tasks like `build` and `release`
  - Now all preparation happens via the `yard:fence:prepare` rake task, which runs as a prerequisite to the `:yard` task

### Fixed

- Fixed `docs/` directory being cleared during `rake build` and `rake release` commands
  - The root cause was `at_load_hook` running at gem load time instead of only when generating documentation
  - Now docs cleanup and tmp file preparation only occur when the `yard` task actually runs

## [0.8.1] - 2025-12-29

- TAG: [v0.8.1][0.8.1t]
- COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 129/129 lines in 4 files
- BRANCH COVERAGE: 100.00% -- 40/40 branches in 4 files
- 40.00% documented

### Added

- `YARD_FENCE_CLEAN_DOCS` environment variable to optionally clear the `docs/` directory before regeneration
  - Set to `true` to enable; prevents stale HTML files from persisting when markdown source files are deleted

### Changed

- `prepare_tmp_files` now clears the `tmp/yard-fence/` staging directory before regenerating files
  - This prevents stale preprocessed files from persisting when source markdown files are deleted
  - Previously, files added manually or by other processes to `tmp/yard-fence/` would remain and get included in documentation
